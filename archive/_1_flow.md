All right so let's say we are to give the presentation tomorrow without any slides with us.

How shall we start? 

Hii everyone, welcome to my second year milestone. Glad to see some familiar faces and new faces here (lol what am I even saying)

So let's start things off. Let's take this model for example. We can't really see what's happening inside it can we? But what if you could poke around and find out what's happening inside the model. And that is where XAI methods come in to play. XAI methods can be local and model agnostic. At first takes a broad swing and look at the some seemingly interconnected XAI methods. If we look at these XAI methods as it is, what we get is simply a table of numbers and cool we can see that these numbers mean how important each feature is. But in reality what we need to see is how these numbers relate to the actual model and the data that was used. That is why in our first research project we propose a set of geometric representations that can be used to visually represent the meaning behind these numbers in the data and model space. In such a context LIME can be represented as Regression lines, SHAP as force vectors, Counterfactuals as connecting lines and Anchors as boxes. 
<!-- Now remember how XAI methods are model agnostic. Let's get a bit more specific about things. Let's get into neural networks. -->
So now I'm stuck at explaining models, and I have to get to my second year project of effect of random numbers on neural networks. 

Now that we have covered model agnostic XAI methods let's get a bit more specific by trying to visualise some model specific XAI methods. Specifically neural networks, cause everyone seems to be talking with an AI these days, so why not start with something like that?
